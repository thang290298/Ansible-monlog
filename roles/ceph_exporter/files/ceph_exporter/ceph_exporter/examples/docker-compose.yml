# Example usage of exporter in use

# In this case, it depends on the proper ceph keys in the correct place. Adapt this to your use case if you would like to use in production

# Change CEPHCONF below to path where your ceph.conf and keys are stored.

# Also, change the password to the Grafana dashboard if you intend to use this further than just testing.
